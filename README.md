# Cookie (Spaceship) Clicker

## Description
Simplified version of the famous game Cookie Clicker made during our training process at Becode. Made in the theme of spaceships.

This game was developed during the week of October 23 to October 29, 2023.

## Link to the game

## Features
### Mandtory
- Multiplier : Multiply the amount of points you generate per click (increases its cost + increases the multiplier value every time it is purchased)
- Bonus : For a limited time double the amount of points you generate per click (increases its cost every time it is purchased)
- Auto-click : Generate points automatically (inscreases its cost and reduces the interval every time it is purchased)

### Bonus
- Landing page
- Some sounds effect as well as backgroung music + mute button (music is blocked by Chrome but works on Firefox)
- Purchase history
- Change the color of your spaceship
- localStorage (keeps track of the score and other parameters on reload/quit of the page) 

## Possible improvements
We also thought about some features that we didnt have time to implement. For example:
- Leaderboard
- More personalization of the player (name changer, possibly skins to buy with points and not for free)
- The purchase history isnt displayed after a reload since the localStorage stores everything as a string and we didnt get time to do "a parsing function" to display it.

## Technologies used
- Html5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Development
Clone our project than use Liveserver to be able to see the development as it's done.

## Note
We could and should have used Vite + JSdoc/TS on this project, but since we didnt think about it in the beginning of it, it seemed counter-productive to add a tool to help us develop and the end of the development. We'll definitely use those tools on next projects
