## Description
Simplified version of the famous game Cookie Clicker made during our training process at Becode. Made in the theme of spaceships This project was a collaborative effort by:

## Link to the game

## Features
### Mandtory
- Multiplier : Multiply the amount of points you generate per click (increases its cost + increases the multiplier value every time it is purchased)
- Bonus : For a limited time double the amount of points you generate per click (increases its cost every time it is purchased)
- Auto-click : Generate points automatically (inscreases its cost and reduces the interval every time it is purchased)

### Bonus
- Landing page
- Some sounds effect as well as backgroung music + mute button (music is blocked by Chrome but works on Firefox)
- Purchase history
- Change the color of your spaceship
- localStorage (keeps track of the score and other parameters on reload/quit of the page) 

## Possible improvements
We also thought about some features that we didnt have time to implement. For example:
- Leaderboard
- More personalization of the player (name changer, possibly skins to buy with points and not for free)
- The purchase history isnt displayed after a reload since the localStorage stores everything as a string and we didnt get time to do "a parsing function" to display it.

## Technologies used
- Html5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Development
Clone our project than use Liveserver to be able to see the development as it's done.

## Note
We could and should have used Vite + JSdoc/TS on this project, but since we didnt think about it in the beginning of it, it seemed counter-productive to add a tool to help us develop and the end of the development. We'll definitely use those tools on next projects
